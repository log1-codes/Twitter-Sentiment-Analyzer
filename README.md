# Twitter Sentiment Analyzer

This project provides an application for analyzing the sentiment of text, specifically trained on Twitter data. It uses a Logistic Regression model to classify input text as positive, negative, or neutral, and provides confidence scores for each sentiment.

## Project Structure

```

├── model/               # Stores the trained sentiment analysis model (pipeline)
│   └── sentiment_pipeline.joblib
├── app.py               # The Streamlit web application script
├── train.py             # Script to train and save the sentiment analysis model

└── README.md            # This file

> **Note:** The model will be saved to `model/sentiment_pipeline.joblib` after training.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository from GitHub:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/log1-codes/Twitter-Sentiment-Analyzer.git
    cd twitter-sentiment-analyzer
    ```

2. **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    * **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    > This will also download necessary NLTK data (`stopwords` and `punkt`) automatically when you run the scripts.

5. **Set up OpenAI API Key:**

    The application requires an OpenAI API key to generate detailed analyses. Set your API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

    * **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```bash
        set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    * **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
        ```

    Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Training the Model

Before running the web application, you need to train the sentiment analysis model. This script will download the TweetEval dataset, preprocess it, train a Logistic Regression model with TF-IDF features, and save the trained model pipeline to the `model/` directory.

To train the model, run:

```bash
python train.py
```

Wait for the training process to complete. You should see messages indicating dataset loading, preprocessing, training progress, and model saving.

## Running the Web Application

Once the model is trained and saved, and your OpenAI API key is set, you can run the Streamlit web application. Ensure your virtual environment is still activated.

To start the web app, run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser with the sentiment analysis application. You can enter text into the provided input box and click "Analyze Sentiment" to see the predicted sentiment, its confidence scores, and a detailed analysis from OpenAI.

## How to Use the App

1. **Enter Text:** Type or paste any sentence or phrase into the text area.
2. **Analyze:** Click the "Analyze Sentiment" button.
3. **View Results:** The application will display the predicted sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral), a chart showing the confidence percentage for each sentiment class, and a detailed explanation generated by the OpenAI model.
